This is a new blog I put together to share some of the photos I&#39;ve taken, using it as a platform to give a behind-the-scenes look at photography.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Technimg (<em>pronounce tech &bull; ni &bull; image</em>) is a combination of three words - technology, technique, and image (or in HTML code speak, &lt;img&gt; which is the tag used to display an image on a website). This is essentially the kind of information I hope to share on this site.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Technology</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>First off, there&#39;s technology. I&#39;ll share some of the technical aspects of a photo. At minimum, this means sharing what kind of equipment and settings were used for the image. I&#39;ve included a handy-dandy feature of viewing an image&#39;s EXIF data, which gives you the details like exposure, aperture and ISO settings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In terms of equipment, I&#39;ll reveal which lenses and camera bodies were used as well as any other &quot;lighting equipment,&quot; both tradition and non-tradition (e.g.: EL Wire and Steel Wool) were used. When relevant, I&#39;ll also share any software and processing tools were used as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Technique</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Next off, I&#39;ll share some of the techniques used. This may blend a little into the settings and equipment, but this will probably give you some insight as to what I did exactly, both during the shot and after it, to get to the final image. This includes sharing about things like my techniques in long exposure, reasons why I had certain settings or used certain lenses, and even some processing work done to enhance color, sharpness, or saturation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Image</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, this site is all about sharing an image. Not only will this include the final image, but sharing some of the original raw and untouched photos and behind the scenes photos as well which will hopefully give some ideas of how some of the setups I used to get a photo done.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&#39;s it for now.

So how was this one done? Let&#39;s start off with the basics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Step One: Long Exposure</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Recently, I&#39;ve become a big fan of long exposure photography because of the unique results it will give you in taking a picture. For this specific photo, I had my camera set to&nbsp;<em>bulb</em>&nbsp;mode, which allows me to essentially let my shutter stay open as long as I&#39;d want. This can be anything from a quick snap (as fast as I can say start and stop), a few seconds, or even a few minutes. In one of my &quot;experiments,&quot; I&#39;ve let my shutter stay open a good 20 minutes. To prevent over-exposure and compensate for the length the shutter was open, I set the aperture to a higher setting to reduce the amount of light coming in to the lens. In this specific photo, I used a shutter opening of f/10, which is pretty closed considering the lens could open up to an f/2.8.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This photo was taken at just 47 seconds, allowing enough time to capture the movement of the things around me. And if you look carefully (like at the building to the left, or some of the traffic lights near by), allowed me to capture some of the static things around me. This was totally unexpected and something that came as a result of a combination of two ideas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Step Two: Technique</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>So that blend of the motion and the static imagry - I call that my technique. With long exposure photography, you&#39;re bound to end up with one of two results. You&#39;ll either get a blurred image or you can get a sharp one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A blurred image is an easy one to get in long exposure photography. You simply open the shutter and move (controllably or uncontrollably) the camera. The resulting photo will look nothing like you&#39;ll recognize, but that&#39;s just because you let things expose for a long time with movement. In this case, I used that idea to capture the lights moving around me. With my car moving my camera forward, I was able to create streaks of the lights that was traveling past my view. However, since the camera&#39;s movement was relative to the car&#39;s movement, the camera stayed still enough to capture the image as a static object, thus no blur for the interior of my car.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Next there&#39;s the idea of capturing the sharpness of scene through long exposure photography. Take the photo below for example.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/gallery/attachment/7/IMG_3994.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This photo was taken at a stop light. By exposing long enough where my car, and thus my camera, just stood still. Keeping my aperture setting quite high, I was able to maintain a sharp image quality, but using long exposure, I was able to ensure enough light came in so I don&#39;t end up with a dark image. In short, long exposures on static shots usually result in sharper images (when not using a flash)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the original shared image, I combined these two uses of long exposure into one photo. As soon as I hit a red light, I let the camera begin exposing, allowing it to capture the static world around me. As traffic zoomed past my non-moving vehicle their headlights created lines of light of where they past. After a few seconds of this (perhaps 20 or 25 seconds), the light turned green and I started moving forward, allowing me to then capture and create light streaks around my car.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a result, the static image was first captured, leaving an &quot;imprint&quot; on the final image, however as I exposued longer, layers were essentially being created, resulting in the original image slowly fading away by the motion being captured captured at a later time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Step Three: ???</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There were many other factors that help get this image. For one, there was just the actual setup of the camera.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/gallery/attachment/5/IMG_5272.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This photo utilized my camera of choice - the<strong> Canon EOS M</strong> - equipped with a <strong>Sigma 10mm</strong> fish eye lens. The fish eye gave me a super wide field of view, framing more of the windows around the car to capture the motion happening. I also utilized an&nbsp;<strong>Ultra-Pod&nbsp;</strong>to secure the tripod to one of the headrests in my car. This table-top tripod features a small size and three fold out legs. While quite simple, the big selling feature to use this tripod for this shoot was the built in velcro strap that allows me to wrap and secure the tripod to my headrest. For added security, &nbsp;I then wrapped the camera&#39;s neck strap around the headrest in case anything came loose. This would catch the camera and minimze damage to the lens or the body.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once the camera was setup, I had to setup my focus. Since the screen was out of view, I did this by first selecting a focus point, told the camera to focus by holding the shutter button half way, and once a focus was established, set the lens to manual focus mode to avoid any changes. For this shoot, the focal point was set to something inside my car.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After the camera&#39;s set, this I began to drive off and take photos in bulb mode. With the camera out of reach, I used Canon&#39;s IR remote to remotely trigger on and off the shutter. During the course of a 30 minute drive, several photos were taken and only a few of them were good. I played around with exposing at different lengths hoping to find a result that just worked perfectly.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I find that the best time to do this would be at night to reduce the amount of ambient light coming into the lens, however I found that there was a sweet spot right when the sun pretty much just setted where you can do these long exposure photographs and still capture enough blue in the sky to give a daylight (or not completely night) feel to the final image.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lastly, once the photo&#39;s been snapped and selected, I took the image and processed it on my computer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Step Four: Profit...I mean Procesing</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The original photo definitely isn&#39;t something much to look at. Colors look flat and it just looked too blown out. Take a look:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/gallery/attachment/6/IMG_4133-2.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To enhance this photo, I took the image into&nbsp;<strong>Adobe Lightroom</strong>, where I was able to process the RAW, uncompressed image to be something that I wanted. I wouldn&#39;t really call this photoshopping or editing the image, but simply processing it. You see, most cameras that save out a JPEG image process a photo for you automatically. My choice however is to not let the camera process the photo at all, saving a RAW file, and giving me the control and power to really say how it&#39;s processed. Not all cameras can do this, but I&#39;ve found that dSLR cameras and some high end point and shoots are capable of this. I&#39;ve yet to see a camera phone with this ability.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So enough with the PSA. What did I do to process this image? Well, the following:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>First I tried to even out some of the highlights and shadows to reduce the overexposed look\r\n	<ul>\r\n		<li>Reduced highlights</li>\r\n		<li>Increased some shadows</li>\r\n		<li>Decreased some of the whites</li>\r\n	</ul>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>This created a washed out image so I then changed the following to impact color\r\n	<ul>\r\n		<li>Increased vibrancy</li>\r\n		<li>Added some clarity (in other programs, this may be known as definition)</li>\r\n		<li>I also reduced the color temperature as adding vibrancy brought out more warmth in the photo</li>\r\n	</ul>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>As a finishing touch, I then added some vignetting. I find that this helps to bring focus to the center of the image</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>That&#39;s pretty much it. A lot of photos were taken and a few were selected. Checkout a few additional photos below:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/gallery/attachment/3/IMG_4134.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/gallery/attachment/8/IMG_4126.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/gallery/attachment/9/IMG_4093.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thanks for reading!

What is RAW you ask? In short, it&#39;s an uncompressed photo format. The long version? Well, I&#39;d say there&#39;s really no long version to that. There just simply is no compression to the photo that was captured.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By not compressing any of the data, you get much more power and control when you start processing your photo on a computer. Take for example this featured photo of the fireworks show at Disneyland and compare it to the original photo featured below.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/gallery/attachment/11/IMG_4058-2.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes, that&#39;s the same photo originating from the same file. However, since RAW gives me more data to work with when it comes to processing the photo, I have better ability to increase the shdows in the photos, decrease the highlights and over exposure, and adjust the clarity of the photo resulting in a photo that you simply can&#39;t get straight out of the camera.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next few days, I&#39;ll be sharing some of the differences that can happen between an original photo from the camera and I&#39;ve done to enhance it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thanks for reading!

I was also equipped with a&nbsp;<strong>Manfrotto 60&quot; tripod</strong>&nbsp;with a ball head. This allowed me to keep the camera steady during the long exposure which captured the fireworks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This image was also captured in RAW, allowing me to give me much more flexibility in&nbsp;<strong>Adobe Lightroom</strong>&nbsp;to process the photo. For this specific photo, the following adjustments were made:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Reduced overall exposure to generally darken the image, helping tone down the highlights from the fireworks and lighting on the castle</li>\r\n	<li>Targeted the highlights (brighter) regions and reduced that intensity even more</li>\r\n	<li>Adjusted the shadow and black regions to reduce it&#39;s darkness, rescuing some of the details that were being hidden in the original image</li>\r\n	<li>Increased vibrancy and saturation to enhance the overal color</li>\r\n	<li>Increased clarity and definition for a sharper look</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, I adjusted individual color levels to level out some colors. This includes:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Increasing green levels to add some more color to the trees which were being underexposed</li>\r\n	<li>Reduced the purples and the blues to help reduce the color shift occuring on the castle when I adjusted the highlights and shadows for the overall photo</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>While the image was shot a low ISO level of 100, I still applied some noise reduction for any noise that might&#39;ve came in when I played with the exposure levels in lightroom. I then also applied a little bit of sharpening to compensate for the little sharpness lost in noise reduction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All that work resulted in a much more colorful photo and brings in some additional details that were lost.

Usually, I&#39;d be the guy that&#39;d opt to stay away from the great outdoors and stick to the comfort and lifestyle the city has to offer, but the photo opportunities this place had to offer was something I couldn&#39;t skip out on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Arriving at the campsite at 10pm at night after a 3 hour long trip, I stepped out of the car, looked up, and right away thought to myself, &quot;Worth it.&quot; You see, what I saw was something I never get to see in the city - a clear sky with no light pollution. The clarity allowed me to see the night sky like I&#39;ve never seen before. There were countless number of stars and I was able to make out constallations with easy, where in comparison I would have trouble marking from the city. Upon setting up the tent and a camp fire, I quickly took out my camera and stayed up late into the night to capture the beauty of this place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the first photographs I took was of the campsite and our tent setup. There was no moon out so the only light source for this one was the camp fire. In person, this created a small glow, illuminating the trees, tent, and other things around the area. However, after a 54 second exposure, I was able to capture enough light to get an image I would be able to work with. I maintained a fairly low ISO of 200 and an Aperture size of f/3.0. The lower ISO setting, or sensor sensitivyt, allowed me to minimize the noise that would be captured with this expsoure setting and the wide aperture opening helped to reduce the exposure needed. I also decided to use my Sigma 10mm Fisheye to maxmize what I could capture. It&#39;s wide angle allowed me to get a large portion of the trees around the site while still mainting the sky above in frame. As a result, I ended up with the following, untouched photo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/gallery/attachment/18/IMG_4154-3.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, this is different to what you see above. Like all my other photos, this one was once again captured with RAW. This allowed me to record as much information as possible to work with in processing the photo later. Once I got home, I took this one into Adobe Lightroom where I &quot;developed&quot; the image, reducing the highlights, increasing the shadows, and playing with the color balance to get to the final image.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/gallery/attachment/14/IMG_4154.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Overall, I&#39;m happy with the photo, but being one of my first night sky starry picture, I&#39;d say I got lucky with this one, but learned a lot to improve photos I&#39;d take on future visit. As a bonus photo, here&#39;s another take from a slightly different angle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/gallery/attachment/15/IMG_4153.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&#39;ve got a few more photos and articles to share the next few days about this trip.

Once again this photo involved a tripod, long exposure, and my fisheye lens to capture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With this photo, the biggest challenge was balancing the lighting to ensure everything exposed properly in the scene. In this case, the only man-made light source were the flood lights coming from the building behind the French Gulch signage. The stars were clearly visible, but weren&#39;t bright enough to illuminate anything for the camera. With a scene like this, I could&#39;ve used a camera flash, but unfortunately, the Canon EOS M I was shooting with does not have one built in. But even if I had a flash, the illumination would&#39;ve just blasted an &quot;uncontrolled&quot; amount of light to the scene, creating a flat look for the image.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, what did I do to make up for the lack of illumination? Well, I had a flashlight on hand and used that to &quot;paint&quot; the scene. Using the flash light, I slowly exposed the areas I wanted to bring out from the darkness. In this case, i started off by shining some light on the main signage. Using quick &quot;swipes&quot; of light on the sign, I was able to evenly light the sign without creating any hotspots. I then proceeded to look at other details around that would be cool to expose. This included the trees, the rocks underneath the signage, the grass, and the road. I varied my swiping speed and amount of light I shined to control the brightness. In some cases, I let my light expose certain spots a little longer than others to create hotshots such as the road. The choice to do this was simply a creative one.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After 60 seconds of exposure at f/2.0 on my Sigma 10mm fisheye, I was able to &quot;light paint&quot; the foreground into the camera while exposing long enough to capture the night sky. From there, I ended up with the un-processed image below and took it into Adobe Lightroom where I processed it into the final image you saw above.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/gallery/attachment/22/IMG_4201-4.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Processing the RAW image still required increasing the original exposure, focusing on increasing the brightness of the shadows and dark areas of the image. This resulted in something milky so to make up for that, I added some additional saturation and vibrancy, but toned down any warm colors to so we don&#39;t have a harsh orange glow from the background building&#39;s floodlights.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&#39;s all for today!

There would be some sort of compromise in each technique, but using those limitations to your advantage can help create interesting photos. In thise case, the motion blur created by the long exposure and the rotation of the planet can help create an effect like you see in the photo above - star trails. This photograph above was the first star trail attempt I made and took a lot of patience and some editing work to get to the final image. So how is this one done?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, to begin, let&#39;s discuss setup. This image was once again captured with my Canon EOS M equipped with a fisheye lens. This one required a tripod to stablize the camera as I was expecting to do a few long exposure captures. Since I knew I was going to go for an extra long exposure, I opted to set my aperture opening to f/5 to preserve some more sharpness in the image. In comparison, I could&#39;ve opted to go for a wide open aperture of f/2.8 which would allow for a more exposed photo, but sharpness was important and an f/5 opening seemed ideal for what I was trying to do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From there, I set my camera setting to ISO 100 for minimal noise and set the camera setting to bulb, which allows me to keep my camera&#39;s shutter open as long as I&#39;d like. Not all cameras have this feature, but if yours does, this is a handy dandy feature for light painting and long exposure photography. In this case, I needed to do some super long exposures so using bulb allowed to get past the 30 second preset available on the camera.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So how long was this exposure? Roughly 12 minutes each - that is not a typo. This was about 12 minutes (maybe closer to the 13 minute mark). After taking my initial photo, I proceeded to capture another image at 12 minutes exposure again. This generated the two photos:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/gallery/attachment/24/IMG_4163-merge.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The two image look pretty identical, but if you look carefully, the blur patterns on the stars are each different. &nbsp;Taking the two images into Adobe Photoshop, I layered them on top of each other and changed the blend mode on the top layer to lighten. This blended the two images to each other, creating an effect that essentially extends the trails of the star. With two images at 12 minute exposures each, you can see this effect, but if I had more time, I would&#39;ve capture additional exposures at similar lengths to really make this photo pop. Unfortunately, clouds slowly creeped in blocking the view on the stars.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After blending in Photoshop, I took the image back to Adobe Lightroom where I further processed the image to reduce the warmth and bring out some color on the starry sky. As a result, I ended up with this final image:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/gallery/attachment/20/IMG_4164-2.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Like I said, I would&#39;ve wanted to do more exposures to really bring out more of the stars but hit some weather related limitatinos (cloudy skies). But for a first time, I&#39;m pretty happy with the result. Next time I attempt this kind of image, I&#39;ll definitely spend more time to photography more exposures. I will also try positioning my camera at different points in the sky. For this one, I got lucky and managed to get the North Star in frame, creating what looks like stars revolving around a single point.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, I hope you enjoyed this one. I have a few more star related photos I&#39;ll be sharing for the rest of the week. so as always, you can<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 25.71428680419922px;\">&nbsp;follw me on&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ryanvalle\" style=\"line-height: 25.71428680419922px; box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(66, 139, 202); text-decoration: none; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 25.71428680419922px;\">&nbsp;or&nbsp;</span><a href=\"http://instagram.com/ryanvalle\" style=\"line-height: 25.71428680419922px; box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(66, 139, 202); text-decoration: none; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 25.71428680419922px;\">&nbsp;for the latest articles and updates.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 25.71428680419922px;\">Thanks for reading!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n',1,1,'2014-07-23 05:02:08','2014-07-24 05:30:14',23,1),(8,'Jumping #Selfie Under the Stars','jumping selfie under the stars','<p>Selfies, or a method of taking a photo of yourself without someone&#39;s help, seems to be the cool thing to do these days,. However, taking a selfie in the dark, 20 feet away from your camera, while jumping seems to be a fun enough challenge to face. With my camera, tripod, flash, and remote on hand, this challenge easily became one of the most fun photo shoots I&#39;ve had. So how did I do this exactly?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, to begin, the jumping selfie photo wasn&#39;t the original plan I had when I brought my camera with me down a pitch dark hike. The initial goal was to just photograph the stars. After the first attempt of doing a long exposure, I ended up with the photo below which had everything I wanted - the lake, the Milky Way galaxy, and the stars. I was happy with this but didn&#39;t want to leave.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/gallery/attachment/29/IMG_4211-2.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I then asked my cousin, &quot;do you want a photo with all this?&quot; Knowing that I had my flash on hand and seeing how easy it was to capture the stars in the background, we proceeded to experiment to capture subjects in this darkness while exposing for the stars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/gallery/attachment/28/IMG_4212-2.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once again, the first attempt was a success. To get this shot, I exposued for roughly the same amount of time as the regular star shot, painting the sand with a flash light, and triggering the flash at the end of the exposure. I had my cousin stand still in the shot for the entire exposure to block the light behind him and prevent a ghosting effect. We proceeded to take more photos. Here&#39;s one of me sitting in the sand:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/gallery/attachment/26/IMG_4213.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was super dark and thought it was okay to move my head a little since there was no light to expose it. I was wrong. When doing these kinds of photos, I learned that even though I&#39;m wasn&#39;t exposing the subject, it was important to still stay still to capture the sharpest image possible. From here, I proceeded to take more photos but eventually reaized that I didn&#39;t really have much of this area. This is where I decided to take the photo you saw originally - a jumping photo selfie with the stars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/gallery/attachment/25/IMG_4222.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To get this done, I once again exposed for the stars. Since I was taking the photo, I was unable to stand in place. But also, since I wanted to do a jumping photo, there was no way for me to just stay up in the air long enough to block the light behind me to avoid the ghosting effect. I accepted the facts of what I couldn&#39;t do for this and activated the shutter. Having my camera on bulb mode, the exposure began. First, I started off my painting light on the ground to start of exposing it for the shot. This took a few seconds - too short to trigger my jump, so I turned off my light and waited. After a minute or so, I ran into place, practiced a few jumps, and when I was ready, jumped up, posed, and triggered the bulb mode stop with my camera remote, which activated the flash. &nbsp;It was a fun shoot and everyone liked how it turned out, so we decided to kick it up a notch and do this with all of us. We ended up with this shot:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/gallery/attachment/30/IMG_4224.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once again, I shot this in RAW so when I got home, I adjusted it to bring up the exposure, detail, and adjusted colors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This was definitely one of the most fun shoots I&#39;ve been on. While it required a lot of patience (each shot took about a minute and a half to do), I&#39;d say the results were worth the time. I&#39;ll definitely have to do this again for my trip. That&#39;s all folks!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thanks for reading!

There&#39;s just something fun about doing a long exposure to capture the trail of the fireworks and seeing what end result it&#39;s pattern and color gives you on your photo. So what does it take to take these photos? Well, there aren&#39;t really rules set in stone to do this, but one general rule is to go manual with your camera controls. Here are some other things I keep in mind:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Go slow!</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In my opinion, show shutters are your friend. Let the camera go on a slower shutter setting to let the camera capture the lines and pattersn the fireworks creates. In the photo above, the 5 second shutter captured the fireworks path from it&#39;s launch or or explosion, creating these unique patterns you don&#39;t see in person.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Go wide!</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another thing I found nice was to use a wide lens. Sure, your milage can vary with this depending on your position relative to the view of the fireworks. For the photo above, I used a zoom lens but kept it at it&#39;s wider settings - around 18mm. The reason for this is that there&#39;s something magical about capturing some context to the viewing area of the fireworks scene.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/gallery/attachment/38/IMG_3920.jpg\" />Take the photo above for example. This photo mainly focuses on the fireworks, which still creates a nice photo in my opinion, but having some context to the scene - people watching, environments, etc - I think a better &quot;emotional connection&quot; is connected to the person looking at it. Just my opinion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Go steady!</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you want to get some nice slow exposures of fireworks, be sure to get a nice tripod. Something tall enough to shoot above of between peoples heads, but portable enough to easily move it around and not be distractive to the others around you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the other challenges with these long exposure shots are the camera shakes you may get between exposures. Even with a tripod, these shakes can come from accidentally bumping a camera leg or just when you trigger your camera&#39;s shutter. How do I overcome these issues?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, the first one is kind of avoidable by avoiding crowded spaces. But if crowded spaces are unavoidable and you have lots of people around you, stop your shutter as soon as you can so you don&#39;t waste time with a blurred photo from a shake. For my slow shutters, I usually use a bulb setting on my camera to really have easy control of shutter speed. So in the case of a camera shake, I immediately close the shutter to prepare for my next shot as the probability that the image was ruined, in my opinion is pretty high.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Regarding the issue with causing shakes from triggering the shutter. With my particular setup, I have two options for this. The first one is to use a remote. For my camera (Canon EOS M), I use an infrared remote that I can use to trigger the camera without even touching it. The only issue with this is that there&#39;s about a 1 second delay from when I click and when the shutter actually activates. This can be a make or break scenario depending on the show I&#39;m photographing, but it is an option for when there isn&#39;t anything else.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The other option is more camera specific. In my case, my camera offers a touch screen where I can lightly tap the screen to activate my shutter and tap it again lightly to close it. This method seems to work pretty well since there is no delay and as long as I&#39;m careful, doesn&#39;t produce the same shake that the normal shutter button would create.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Go Deep!</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Go deep with your depth of field. In other words, close up your aperture and use a higher number setting. In this case, I used a f/14 opening. Reason for this is many. First of all, closing the aperture a bit reduces the light coming in. When using a slower shutter, this compensates for any possible over exposures you may face. Secondly, closing your aperture a bit also helps bring out more sharpness in the image.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Go RAW!</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lastly, shoot in RAW if you can. This allows you to store as much data on the photo to &quot;develop&quot; and process it on a computer later on. This way, if your image appears dark (which likely it will), you can brighten the image up a little, bring out some saturation, or additional sharpness. For some reference, check out the original photo before I processed it to what you see above.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/gallery/attachment/36/IMG_4063-2.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For some more examples, I&#39;ve posted some before and after pictures below.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>BEFORE</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/gallery/attachment/32/IMG_4080-2.jpg\" /></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>AFTER</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/gallery/attachment/31/IMG_4080.jpg\" /></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For this photo, notice how I was able to restore the shadows, enhance the exposures, and bring out some additional details that were lost in the original.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And one more...</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>BEFORE</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/gallery/attachment/34/IMG_4082-2.jpg\" /></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>AFTER</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/gallery/attachment/33/IMG_4082.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once again, a similar adjustment to the previous photo. I exposed up some of the darker areas, restoring some details on areas like the trees and the crowd around as well as increased the saturation to bring out some color in the scene. One additional thing I did with this one is tone down some of the highlights and brightness so you don&#39;t get such a blown out look on the explosions itself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, that&#39;s pretty much it. There were four key things I keep in mind:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, use a slower shutter to capture the movement and streak of the fireworks</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Second, go wide so you can get some context of what the fireworks show is like.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Third, use a tripod to go steady and get a nice sharp picture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fourth, use a narrower aperture setting to get a sharper image and prevent over exposure with your fireworks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lastly, shoot in RAW so you can further enhance your capture later.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&#39;s about it.

You&#39;ve probably heard about it in some way, shape, or form whether it be from your favorite tech blog praising how cool the device is or from your local media outlet talking about privacy conerns about the wearable device with a built in camera. Personally, I&#39;ve been excited about it and this opportunity to demo the device was something I was looking forward to do for quite some time now. Here are my thoughts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To begin, do remember that this device is currently still in beta and development by Google. I only had about 30 minutes to use the device and some features were limited to the demo unit. With that in mind, the context of this article should be taken as a &quot;first look&quot; and an opinionated article - nothing really based on facts and what the final product Google plans to release. With that said, let&#39;s continue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/gallery/attachment/41/IMG_4255.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, let&#39;s begin with the hardware. There&#39;s not much to say. The unit is small with only one button which during our demo really functioned to activate the camera and shutter. In addition, there was also the entire side which was touch sensitve and functioned like a trackpad. There was also a built in camera and the actual glass which worked as a heads up display.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wearing the device was actually quite comfortable. The weight was just right and I didn&#39;t feel self-concious wearing this no wearable tech on my face. However, staring at the mirror, you can see that the device was in no way discreet to everyone else. You will definitely get looks from the general public. Back to your point of view, the prism element that sits on top of your right eye wasn&#39;t too distracting either. When worn correctly, it sits on the top right hand frame of your view. If you were to wear this at all times, I feel like I wouldn&#39;t be too distracted, but if you were going to use this often, it may be annoying and not very natural to be staring up to access the information you want to get to. From the descriptions I was reading, I was hoping it would be like an augmented reality heads up display that covers your entire field of view. Nope - that&#39;s still a piece of science fiction. The experience is like someone holding up a monitor towards the top right side of your view. It&#39;s a great spot for quick bursts of information, but don&#39;t expect to browse Facebook all day or read an entire news article on Glass.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Personally, I think the hardware will need some work to get slimmed down a bit before the general public accepts the device for everyday wear.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, it&#39;s the applications and software which I think will make Glass stand out. During our demo, we were presented with several of Glass apps which I believe are default applications. There wasn&#39;t really anything anything unique to Glass, but experiencing these existing applications on a new form factor made the experience much more interesting. Recalling back, some of these applications included basic search, translation features, camera and video features, and an astronomy app.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With search, the functionality was easy to use and felt quite accurate. I simply activated the search function by saying &quot;Ok Glass. Google places to visit.&quot; There wasn&#39;t a microphone in front of me (and in fact, I&#39;m not sure where the microphone itself was), but the device understood me clearly, searching for what I wanted exactly pretty quickly. The results came up as individual cards on screen. I can swipe left and right on the side of Glass to navigate around the search results and tap to select it. Pages will render to preview the search result&#39;s website content, but with a screen that small, it was hard to consume and read the content on Glass.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another application we tried out was the translation app. This application utilized the camera to read signs and text in front of you, translating those words to the desired language. In the demo we had, I set the translation from English to French and looked at a sign that had the Google Glass logo. After a second, the Glass detected the word and translated it to &quot;verre.&quot; The translations itself were pretty cool as it overlayed the existing text with the translation itself, giving you an augmented reality experience. Wanting to travel the world eventually, I could see myself using this feature a lot as a explored the streets of Paris, Rome, China, and other places I want to step foot someday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then there were camera and video features. None of these really stood out to me as I still preferred to use the camera on my phone or an actual camera to take pictures and photos. I can see some good use for this, but in regards to the demo, it was one of the cool features, but a feature I could see my self not really using as well. Speaking to our host, it seemed like a big use of the camera feature though were for Google hangouts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lastly, there was one last cool app that was demoed to us - an astronomy app. My guess the device was using GPS, accelerometers, and gyroscopes to make the magic happen, but the overal experience of this application was just cool. What this app did was load a constellation map onto your Glass. As you looked up and tilted your head around, Glass would point out different stars and constellations that were right above you. If I had Glass during my camping trip last weekend, this would&#39;ve been a cool thing to have on hand. But then again, this app was nothing new to Google Glass and there are similar apps and functionalities you can find for your smartphone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/gallery/attachment/42/IMG_4254.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>After demoing a few apps, I tried on a few additional frames to see what it&#39;d be like to use Glass with glasses. Overall, it was still comfortable and felt better to wear with actual glasses instead of the headband rim they give you be default. The glasses available could also be done as a prescription, but looking at the ones I liked, they seemed a little thin framed and not ideal for anybody needing high index lenses like myself. Also, I asked about the ease of removing Glass from the designer frames. Unfortunately, it takes a scren to remove Glass from the frames so it seems like this wouldn&#39;t replaace an existing set of prescriptinos but rather add on to them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All in all, Glass, in my opinion is a cool device and what it can do for a product considered in development, is quite amazing. However, I feel that it&#39;s still a long way to go before it can appeal to a larger market. Currently, Google Glass is available through <a href=\"https://glass.google.com\">Google&#39;s Explorer Program</a>&nbsp;which would set you back a nice $1,500 for just Glass - frames and accessories may cost extra. I&#39;ve seen several people go with this program to get Glass so there is some interest in it, but personally, I feel it is a hefty price to pay for a device still in development with limited functionality. I did like what I saw and look forward to what comes next out of this program. I&#39;ll keep tracking to see where Glass goes from here and look forward to hopefully picking one up on it&#39;s final release.</p>\r\n',1,1,'2014-07-27 00:46:44','2014-07-27 06:40:08',39,0),(11,'Capturing the Milky Way Galaxy','capturing the milky way galaxy','<p>Whoops! It&#39;s been a few days and I haven&#39;t posted anything here. I haven&#39;t had much time to actually go out and take some photos to blog about, but let&#39;s pull this one out again from my camping trip a few days ago. The thing I like about this specific photo is how I managed to get the Milky Way to expose and become the focal point of the photo. This photo was made possible by the lack of light pollution from where it was taken and the (mostly) clear skies. There was a lingering cloud that kind of got in the way of the shot, but for the most part, it was mostly clear.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once again, this scene was pretty much dark to the point where it was difficult and near impossible to see anything around you. There was a small camp fire going on to the right of the photo which provided some visibility and prevented me from tripping on anything, but that was it. So like the previous photos, I set my camera to the widest aperture setting my lens offered (which was a f/2.0) and let my camera run on bulb mode, exposing for a total of 41 seconds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Without any artificial lighting, this wouldn&#39;t allow me to expose much of the scenery that existed, so I used a flashlight to illuminate the stuff around the camera. I used quick motions to prevent any unwanted &quot;hotspots.&quot; In addition, I used my hand to create shadows which functioned like light masks to selectively light certain scenes. I primarily used this technique to cast a shadow on the ground while I shined my light to the distant trees. My flashlight had a fairly far reach and was fairly wide angled so using this shadow technique gave me some control of what I wanted illuminated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once the photo was taken, I did some of the usual processing I did with my past photos, increasing exposure and shadow areas to help bring out the details which would have otherwise been lost. Increasing the exposure usually results in colors getting washed out so I also increased the vibrancy to help balance things out to a more visually appealing level. Just for fun, take a look at the original photo below.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/gallery/attachment/44/IMG_4203.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&#39;s it for today.

I apologize for the absence the past few weeks -- I haven&#39;t really had much time to take any new photos. Anyways, I finally took some time out of my night last night and decided it was time to do some fun photoshoots. One thing that was on my mind was to photograph a little metallic R2-D2 model I had assembled from a kit recently. Mainly, I was curious to see what kind of interesting shots I could take with it&#39;s highly reflective textures. Grabbing some steel wool I had left over from a previous shoot, I decided to experiment and see what I could capture.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First off, to give some context as to what I was shooting, take a look at this photo of the same model captured via an iPhone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/gallery/attachment/47/Unknown.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, how did I take this shot? Well, to start off, the basic idea behind this one is long exposure photography. I first setup my camera on a tripod and enabled full manual controls. I opted for a higher aperture number for a sharper image and set the ISO as low as possible to reduce any noise from the long exposure. Having the higher aperture and lower ISO also allowed me to expose longer without risking over-exposure as I let the steel wool burn. Since the actual burn rate of the steel wool can be quite unpreditable, I also set my camera to a bulb setting.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once my settings were set, I turned off any lights around me, triggered the shutter, and then ignited the steel wool on top of the shot. As the sparks feel, the steel wool&#39;s drop was recorded onto the shot, creating streaks in the frame resulting int he trails you see in the final image. I waved the wool from left to right and bobbled it up and down to let the sparks fall within the designated area.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There then hit a point when the sparks stopped falling, but the wool continued to glow a nice orange glow. I used this light source to then expose the figure a little more. I slowly moved the wool around the shot, being careful not to get in frame. As a result, this created the orange glow you see in the photo.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a bonus, I took out a spare camera I had and decided to record a short video on how this was put together. Take a look.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/6CShjX6sHkk\" style=\"width:100%; height: 320px; max-width: 640px; margin: 0 auto;\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, that&#39;s it for now.

It was challenging to capture the exact frame I want because it&#39;s super wide field of view, but with some cropping in Lightroom, I was able to snap some shots I&#39;m fairly happy with. This featured shot is a long exposure of the dancing monkey segment in Disneyland&#39;s Fantasmic show. The rafts they were on had some fire torches, which with the long exposure created a streak of fire floating in the middle of the air while the performers dressed in glowing monkey outfits created these interesting patterns as the passed across the screen.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Take a look at a few more long exposure shots from the show.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/gallery/attachment/49/IMG_4589.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/gallery/attachment/50/IMG_4602.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/gallery/attachment/51/IMG_4604.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/gallery/attachment/52/IMG_4605.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/gallery/attachment/53/IMG_4606.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, that&#39;s it for now.

For example, take this piece of mechanical wizardry. In it&#39;s simplest form, I see it as something that is designed to just spin in circles. Now combine that functionality with photography and you can get some interesting photos.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Grabbing my camera and fisheye lens for this one, I captured a long exposure shot. The spinning movement, combined with the vertical movement of the vehicle extensions attached on allowed me to capture streaks of light as the ride spun in circles, resulting in the photo you see above.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, as the vehicles adjusted their height, I was able to capture different paterns this &quot;machine&quot; was making. Take a look.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/gallery/attachment/55/IMG_4610.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Capturing this was pretty simple. I setup a tripod and setup my camera in bulb mode. My fisheye lens opens to a wide f/2.8 but for this shot, I went for a medium aperture setting of f/8.0 to help capture a sharper image. If I went for a wider aperture, I could&#39;ve exposed for a shorter time but that would&#39;ve resulted in fewer streaks where as a higher apertuer would&#39;ve (or might&#39;ve) resulted in a slightly sharper image, but I would&#39;ve needed to expose for a longer time, resulting in more light streaks in the image. At f/8.0, I exposed for about 20 seconds for each shot to capture the image. Oh, also, since this was a long exposure shot, it helped blur out the people moving around the scene leaving the photo looking empty when in fact it had a good amount of foot traffic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, that&#39;s about it for this one.&nbsp;As always, you can&nbsp;follow me @ryanvalle on both&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/ryanvalle\">Twitter</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://instagram.com/ryanvalle\">Instagram</a>&nbsp;for the latest updates and photo shares.</p>\r\n',1,1,'2014-08-11 04:59:06','2014-08-12 03:58:37',54,1),(15,'Capturing a Silhouette','capturing a silhouette','<p>It&#39;s been a while since I last shared a photo, so for this one, I pulled out my R2-D2 metal figure&nbsp;<a href=\"http://technimg.com/article/12-steel-wool-fun\">featured in a previous post</a>. This photo was taken with my Canon EOS M with the Canon 18-55mm EF-M lens. Since this was a long exposure, I used the Ultrapod II mini tripod I had to be able to get a stable shot at such a low level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For lighting, I utilized a flashlight and some steel wool. A flashlight was positioned directly behind the model to create a the lighting effect behind the figure while I used steel wool to light the front of the droid. The reflective characteristics of the model made it really easy ot light the front of the model.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I white balanced in favor of the steel wool&#39;s warmth which resulted in an extremely blue background as the two light sources had dastric color temperatures. As a result, the background light came out to a more extreme cool tone (blue) compared to what was seen in person.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a bonus, here&#39;s an alternative photo taken with steel wool being used in a different way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/gallery/attachment/57/IMG_4314.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This photo was once again a long exposure, but instead of having the steel wool burn in front of the model, I let the steel wool fall from above, creating a raining effect.
